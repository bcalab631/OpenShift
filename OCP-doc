Kubernetes authentication in Vault enables secure, identity-based access to secrets for applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Instead of hardcoding credentials, applications authenticate to Vault using their Kubernetes service account tokens, gaining tightly scoped and auditable access to sensitive data.

Vault Setup: Vault is configured to trust the Kubernetes cluster (API server & CA certs).

Role Mapping: Specific Kubernetes service accounts are mapped to Vault roles and policies.

App Authentication: Applications use their Kubernetes service account token to authenticate to Vault.

Secret Access: Vault verifies the token and grants access to secrets based on the mapped policy.

Endpoint: auth/kubernetes/config is the configuration path for setting up Kubernetes-specific auth settings.
Vault uses this JWT to call the Kubernetes TokenReview API to validate incoming service account tokens during auth.
Specifies the Kubernetes (or OpenShift) API server URL that Vault will connect to for verifying tokens.
Ensures secure communication by validating the Kubernetes API server’s SSL certificate.
This vault write command configures Vault to authenticate with a Kubernetes (or OpenShift) cluster by:

Supplying a service account JWT for token validation,

Specifying the Kubernetes API server address,

Providing the CA certificate to securely connect to the API server.

vault write auth/kubernetes/role/example-role \
 This role defines how Kubernetes service accounts can authenticate to Vault and what they’re allowed to do.
 bound_service_account_names=example-sa \
Limits which service accounts can assume this Vault role.
bound_service_account_namespaces=example-namespace \
Adds another layer of restriction, ensuring the role is used only within specific namespaces.
policies=example-policy \
Defines what the authenticated entity can access within Vault.
ttl=1h
Token will expire in 1 hour unless renewed.
This command defines a Vault Kubernetes auth role, binding it to a specific service account and namespace. It assigns Vault policies and token lifetime, controlling who can authenticate from Kubernetes and what they can access in Vault.

Integrating HashiCorp Vault with OpenShift requires specific configurations on the OpenShift side to ensure secure, reliable authentication and secret access from applications running in the cluster.

This summary outlines the key setup steps, permissions, and best practices required on OpenShift to support Vault's Kubernetes authentication method.

1. Service Account Creation
Each application that needs to access Vault should run under a dedicated OpenShift service account.

2. RBAC: Allow TokenReview Permissions
Vault needs permission to validate service account tokens via the Kubernetes TokenReview API.
Create a ClusterRoleBinding for the Vault service account (used by Vault if running inside OpenShift):

3. Security Context Constraints (SCC)
If using Vault Agent or CSI Provider, the pod may require specific SCCs depending on the method:

Vault Agent Sidecar often requires anyuid or privileged SCC.

Vault CSI Provider might require a custom SCC allowing necessary volume mounts or file access.

4. Deploy Applications with the Service Account
Ensure applications use the service account linked to a Vault role.

5. (Optional) Vault Agent Injector Setup
If using Vault Agent sidecar injection, annotate deployments to enable auto-auth and secret templating:

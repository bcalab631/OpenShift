Kubernetes authentication in Vault enables secure, identity-based access to secrets for applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Instead of hardcoding credentials, applications authenticate to Vault using their Kubernetes service account tokens, gaining tightly scoped and auditable access to sensitive data.

Vault Setup: Vault is configured to trust the Kubernetes cluster (API server & CA certs).

Role Mapping: Specific Kubernetes service accounts are mapped to Vault roles and policies.

App Authentication: Applications use their Kubernetes service account token to authenticate to Vault.

Secret Access: Vault verifies the token and grants access to secrets based on the mapped policy.

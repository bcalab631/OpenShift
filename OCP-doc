Kubernetes authentication in Vault enables secure, identity-based access to secrets for applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Instead of hardcoding credentials, applications authenticate to Vault using their Kubernetes service account tokens, gaining tightly scoped and auditable access to sensitive data.

Vault Setup: Vault is configured to trust the Kubernetes cluster (API server & CA certs).

Role Mapping: Specific Kubernetes service accounts are mapped to Vault roles and policies.

App Authentication: Applications use their Kubernetes service account token to authenticate to Vault.

Secret Access: Vault verifies the token and grants access to secrets based on the mapped policy.

Integrating HashiCorp Vault with OpenShift requires specific configurations on the OpenShift side to ensure secure, reliable authentication and secret access from applications running in the cluster.

This summary outlines the key setup steps, permissions, and best practices required on OpenShift to support Vault's Kubernetes authentication method.

1. Service Account Creation
Each application that needs to access Vault should run under a dedicated OpenShift service account.

2. RBAC: Allow TokenReview Permissions
Vault needs permission to validate service account tokens via the Kubernetes TokenReview API.
Create a ClusterRoleBinding for the Vault service account (used by Vault if running inside OpenShift):

3. Security Context Constraints (SCC)
If using Vault Agent or CSI Provider, the pod may require specific SCCs depending on the method:

Vault Agent Sidecar often requires anyuid or privileged SCC.

Vault CSI Provider might require a custom SCC allowing necessary volume mounts or file access.

4. Deploy Applications with the Service Account
Ensure applications use the service account linked to a Vault role.

5. (Optional) Vault Agent Injector Setup
If using Vault Agent sidecar injection, annotate deployments to enable auto-auth and secret templating:

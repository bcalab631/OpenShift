#JIRA Feature

Description:

As part of the ongoing integration of OpenShift with HashiCorp Vault for centralized management of secrets and PKI certificates, we have successfully completed the proof of concept (POC). The next phase involves implementing the Vault Agent Injector to enable secure secret injection into applications running on the OpenShift platform.

This feature will track all pre-implementation activities, including planning, documentation, configuration validation, stakeholder alignment, and initial environment preparation necessary to support the full-scale rollout of the Vault Injector.

Objectives:

Finalize requirements and implementation strategy for Vault Injector.

Prepare OpenShift environment for integration.

Coordinate with security and platform teams for validation.

Develop runbooks and operational documentation.
